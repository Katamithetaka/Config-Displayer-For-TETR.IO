# TETR.IO Config Displayer
This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript project made to display a TETR.IO config (notably keybinds and handling settings) directly from a web interface, making it easily shareable.

# Features

- Adding keyboard layouts (See Contributing)
- Setting and changing key colors
- Enabling / Disabling which keys are rendered on the screen
- Showing or not showing handling settings
- ðŸš€ BLAZINGLY FAST. Yes, I can say it, this is such a small website with so little code and no framework it would honestly be complicated to make it slow.
- Keyboard layout generation scripts.

# Contributing

I accept mostly all or any contribution, from updating text to adding keyboard layouts. I don't think performance upgrades are relevant for this project but in case there's performance issues I can also accept contribution on that side of things.

# License

This project is fully open-source and you are allowed to use this code commercially as long as your source code also contributes to the Open Source Ecosystem.
Thanks.
